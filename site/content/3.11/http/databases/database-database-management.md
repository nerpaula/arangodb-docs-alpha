This is an introduction to ArangoDB's HTTP interface for managing databases.

The HTTP interface for databases provides operations to create and drop
individual databases. These are mapped to the standard HTTP methods *POST*
and *DELETE*. There is also the *GET* method to retrieve an array of existing
databases.

Please note that all database management operations can only be accessed via
the default database (*_system*) and none of the other databases.

paths:
  /_api/database/current:
    get:
      description: |2+
        Retrieves the properties of the current database
        The response is a JSON object with the following attributes:
        - *name*: the name of the current database
        - *id*: the id of the current database
        - *path*: the filesystem path of the current database
        - *isSystem*: whether or not the current database is the *_system* database
        - *sharding*: the default sharding method for collections created in this database
        - *replicationFactor*: the default replication factor for collections in this database
        - *writeConcern*: the default write concern for collections in this database

      responses:
        '200':
          description: |2
            is returned if the information was retrieved successfully.
        '400':
