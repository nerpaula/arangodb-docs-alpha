    put:
      description: |2+
        You can call this endpoint to try to cache this collection's index entries in
        the main memory. Index lookups served from the memory cache can be much faster
        than lookups not stored in the cache, resulting in a performance boost.
        The endpoint iterates over suitable indexes of the collection and stores the
        indexed values (not the entire document data) in memory. This is implemented for
        edge indexes only.
        The endpoint returns as soon as the index warmup has been scheduled. The index
        warmup may still be ongoing in the background, even after the return value has
        already been sent. As all suitable indexes are scanned, it may cause significant
        I/O activity and background load.
        This feature honors memory limits. If the indexes you want to load are smaller
        than your memory limit, this feature guarantees that most index values are
        cached. If the index is larger than your memory limit, this feature fills
        up values up to this limit. You cannot control which indexes of the collection
        should have priority over others.
        It is guaranteed that the in-memory cache data is consistent with the stored
        index data at all times.
        On success, this endpoint returns an object with attribute `result` set to `true`.
      operationId: ' handleCommandPut:loadIndexes'

                    startup option. The cache can speed up repeated reads of the same documents via

                  description: |+
                    (The default is *1*): in a cluster, this attribute determines how many copies
                    of each shard are kept on different DB-Servers. The value 1 means that only one
                    copy (no synchronous replication) is kept. A value of k means that k-1 replicas
                    are kept. It can also be the string `"satellite"` for a SatelliteCollection,
                    where the replication factor is matched to the number of DB-Servers
                    (Enterprise Edition only).
                    Any two copies reside on different DB-Servers. Replication between them is
                    synchronous, that is, every write operation to the "leader" copy will be replicated
                    to all "follower" replicas, before the write operation is reported successful.
                    If a server fails, this is detected automatically and one of the servers holding
                    copies take over, usually without an error being reported.

                    It determines how many copies of each shard are required to be
                    in sync on the different DB-Servers. If there are less then these many copies
                    in the cluster a shard will refuse to write. Writes to shards with enough
                    up-to-date copies will succeed at the same time however. The value of
                    *writeConcern* can not be larger than *replicationFactor*. _(cluster only)_
