This is an overview of ArangoDB's HTTP interface for miscellaneous functions.

```http-spec

  /_api/version:
    get:
      description: |2+
        Returns the server name and version number. The response is a JSON object
        with the following attributes:
      operationId: ' RestVersionHandler'
      parameters:
      - name: details
        schema:
          type: boolean
        required: false
        description: |+
          If set to *true*, the response will contain a *details* attribute with
          additional information about included components and their versions. The
          attribute names and internals of the *details* object may vary depending on
          platform and ArangoDB version.

                      may contain a number or a textual version.

                      returned only if the *details* query parameter is set to *true* in the
                      request.

<!-- lib/Admin/RestShutdownHandler.cpp -->
```http-spec
openapi: 3.0.2
paths:
  /_admin/shutdown:
    delete:
      description: |2+
        This call initiates a clean shutdown sequence. Requires administrative privileges.
      operationId: ' RestShutdownHandler'
      parameters:
      - name: soft
        schema:
          type: boolean
        required: false
        description: |+
          <small>Introduced in v3.7.12, v3.8.1, v3.9.0</small>
          If set to `true`, this initiates a soft shutdown. This is only available
          on Coordinators. When issued, the Coordinator tracks a number of ongoing
          operations, waits until all have finished, and then shuts itself down
          normally. It will still accept new operations.
          This feature can be used to make restart operations of Coordinators less
          intrusive for clients. It is designed for setups with a load balancer in front
          of Coordinators. Remove the designated Coordinator from the load balancer before
          issuing the soft-shutdown. The remaining Coordinators will internally forward
          requests that need to be handled by the designated Coordinator. All other
          requests will be handled by the remaining Coordinators, reducing the designated
          Coordinator's load.
          The following types of operations are tracked
           - AQL cursors (in particular streaming cursors)
           - Transactions (in particular stream transactions)
           - Pregel runs (conducted by this Coordinator)
           - Ongoing asynchronous requests (using the `x-arango-async store` HTTP header
           - Finished asynchronous requests, whose result has not yet been
             collected
           - Queued low priority requests (most normal requests)
           - Ongoing low priority requests

            number of active operations of the various types. Once all numbers have gone
            to 0, the flag `allClear` is set and the Coordinator shuts down automatically.

        Executes the javascript code in the body on the server as the body
        of a function with no arguments. If you have a *return* statement
        then the return value you produce will be returned as content type
        *application/json*. If the parameter *returnAsJSON* is set to
        *true*, the result will be a JSON object describing the return value
        directly, otherwise a string produced by JSON.stringify will be

        Note that this API endpoint will only be present if the server was
        started with the option `--javascript.allow-admin-execute true`.
        The default value of this option is `false`, which disables the execution of
        user-defined code and disables this API endpoint entirely.
