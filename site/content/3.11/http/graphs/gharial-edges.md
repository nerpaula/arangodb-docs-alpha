Examples will explain the REST API for [manipulating edges](../../graphs/general-graphs/graphs-general-graphs-functions)
of the [graph module](../../graphs/)
on the [knows graph](../../graphs/#the-knows_graph):

        Within the body the edge has to contain a *_from* and *_to* value referencing to valid vertices in the graph.
        Furthermore the edge has to be valid in the definition of the used edge collection.
