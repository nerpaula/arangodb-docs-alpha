        Creates a TTL index for the collection *collection-name* if it
        does not already exist. The call expects an object containing the index
        details.
      operationId: ' createIndex:ttl'
      parameters:
      - name: collection
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
        description: |+
          The collection name.

                  description: |+
                    must be equal to *"ttl"*.
                name:
                  type: string
                  description: |+
                    An easy-to-remember name for the index to look it up or refer to it in index hints.
                    Index names are subject to the same character restrictions as collection names.
                    If omitted, a name is auto-generated so that it is unique with respect to the
                    collection, e.g. `idx_832910498`.
                fields:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: string
                  description: |+
                    an array with exactly one attribute path.
                expireAfter:
                  type: number
                  description: |+
                    The time interval (in seconds) from the point in time stored in the `fields`
                    attribute after which the documents count as expired. Can be set to `0` to let
                    documents expire as soon as the server time passes the point in time stored in
                    the document attribute, or to a higher number to delay the expiration.
                inBackground:
                  type: boolean
                  description: |+
                    The optional attribute **inBackground** can be set to *true* to create the index
                    in the background, which will not write-lock the underlying collection for
                    as long as if the index is built in the foreground. The default value is *false*.
              required:
              - type
              - fields
              - expireAfter
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |2
            If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is returned.
        '201':
          description: |2
            If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
            is returned.
        '400':
          description: |2
            If the collection already contains another TTL index, then an *HTTP 400* is
            returned, as there can be at most one TTL index per collection.
        '404':
          description: |2
            If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.
