```http-spec
openapi: 3.0.2
paths:
  /_admin/server/tls:
    get:
      description: |2+
        Return a summary of the TLS data. The JSON response will contain a field
        `result` with the following components:
          - `keyfile`: Information about the key file.
          - `clientCA`: Information about the CA for client certificate
            verification.
        If server name indication (SNI) is used and multiple key files are
        configured for different server names, then there is an additional
        attribute `SNI`, which contains for each configured server name
        the corresponding information about the key file for that server name.
        In all cases the value of the attribute will be a JSON object, which
        has a subset of the following attributes (whatever is appropriate):
          - `sha256`: The value is a string with the SHA256 of the whole input
            file.
          - `certificates`: The value is a JSON array with the public
            certificates in the chain in the file.
          - `privateKeySha256`: In cases where there is a private key (`keyfile`
            but not `clientCA`), this field is present and contains a
            JSON string with the SHA256 of the private key.
        This API requires authentication.

        returns a summary. The JSON response is exactly as in the corresponding

        This is a protected API and can only be executed with superuser rights.

        new user key.
        This is a protected API and can only be executed with superuser rights.

        This is a public API so it does *not* require authentication. It is meant to be
        used only in the context of server monitoring.
      operationId: ' handleAvailability'
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |2
            This API will return HTTP 200 in case the server is up and running and usable for
            arbitrary operations, is not set to read-only mode and is currently not a follower
            in case of an active failover setup.

            HTTP 503 will be returned in case the server is during startup or during shutdown,

openapi: 3.0.2
paths:
  /_admin/cluster/health:
    get:
      description: |2+
        Queries the health of the cluster for monitoring purposes. The response is a JSON object, containing the standard `code`, `error`, `errorNum`, and `errorMessage` fields as appropriate. The endpoint-specific fields are as follows:
        - `ClusterId`: A UUID string identifying the cluster
        - `Health`: An object containing a descriptive sub-object for each node in the cluster.
          - `<nodeID>`: Each entry in `Health` will be keyed by the node ID and contain the following attributes:
            - `Endpoint`: A string representing the network endpoint of the server.
            - `Role`: The role the server plays. Possible values are `"AGENT"`, `"COORDINATOR"`, and `"DBSERVER"`.
            - `CanBeDeleted`: Boolean representing whether the node can safely be removed from the cluster.
            - `Version`: Version String of ArangoDB used by that node.
            - `Engine`: Storage Engine used by that node.
            - `Status`: A string indicating the health of the node as assessed by the supervision (Agency). This should be considered primary source of truth for Coordinator and DB-Servers node health. If the node is responding normally to requests, it is `"GOOD"`. If it has missed one heartbeat, it is `"BAD"`. If it has been declared failed by the supervision, which occurs after missing heartbeats for about 15 seconds, it will be marked `"FAILED"`.
            Additionally it will also have the following attributes for:
            **Coordinators** and **DB-Servers**
            - `SyncStatus`: The last sync status reported by the node. This value is primarily used to determine the value of `Status`. Possible values include `"UNKNOWN"`, `"UNDEFINED"`, `"STARTUP"`, `"STOPPING"`, `"STOPPED"`, `"SERVING"`, `"SHUTDOWN"`.
            - `LastAckedTime`: ISO 8601 timestamp specifying the last heartbeat received.
            - `ShortName`: A string representing the shortname of the server, e.g. `"Coordinator0001"`.
            - `Timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp specifying the last heartbeat received. (deprecated)
            - `Host`: An optional string, specifying the host machine if known.
            **Coordinators** only
            - `AdvertisedEndpoint`: A string representing the advertised endpoint, if set. (e.g. external IP address or load balancer, optional)
            **Agents**
            - `Leader`: ID of the Agent this node regards as leader.
            - `Leading`: Whether this Agent is the leader (true) or not (false).
            - `LastAckedTime`: Time since last `acked` in seconds.
