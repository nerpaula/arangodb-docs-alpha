### Transactions

ArangoDB's transactions are executed on the server. Transactions can be 
executed by clients in two different ways:

1. Via the [Stream Transaction](transaction-stream-transaction) API
2. Via the [JavaScript Transaction](transaction-js-transaction) API

For a more detailed description of the transaction types, how transactions work
in ArangoDB, and what guarantees ArangoDB provide, please refer to
[Transactions](../../transactions/).
