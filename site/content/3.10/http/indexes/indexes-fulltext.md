        Creates a fulltext index for the collection *collection-name*, if
        it does not already exist. The call expects an object containing the index
        details.
      operationId: ' createIndex#fulltext'
      parameters:
      - name: collection
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
        description: |+
          The collection name.

                  description: |+
                    must be equal to *"fulltext"*.
                name:
                  type: string
                  description: |+
                    An easy-to-remember name for the index to look it up or refer to it in index hints.
                    Index names are subject to the same character restrictions as collection names.
                    If omitted, a name is auto-generated so that it is unique with respect to the
                    collection, e.g. `idx_832910498`.
                fields:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: string
                  description: |+
                    an array of attribute names. Currently, the array is limited
                    to exactly one attribute.
                minLength:
                  type: integer
                  format: int64
                  description: |+
                    Minimum character length of words to index. Will default
                    to a server-defined value if unspecified. It is thus recommended to set
                    this value explicitly when creating the index.
                inBackground:
                  type: boolean
                  description: |+
                    The optional attribute **inBackground** can be set to *true* to create the index
                    in the background, which will not write-lock the underlying collection for
                    as long as if the index is built in the foreground. The default value is *false*.
              required:
              - type
              - fields
              - minLength
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |2
            If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is
            returned.
        '201':
          description: |2
            If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
            is returned.
        '404':
          description: |2
            If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.
