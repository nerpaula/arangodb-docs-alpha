```http-spec
openapi: 3.0.2
paths:
  /_api/foxx/tests:
    post:
      description: |2+
        Runs the tests for the service at the given mount path and returns the results.
        Supported test reporters are:
        - *default*: a simple list of test cases
        - *suite*: an object of test cases nested in suites
        - *stream*: a raw stream of test results
        - *xunit*: an XUnit/JUnit compatible structure
        - *tap*: a raw TAP compatible stream
        The *Accept* request header can be used to further control the response format:
        When using the *stream* reporter `application/x-ldjson` will result
        in the response body being formatted as a newline-delimited JSON stream.
        When using the *tap* reporter `text/plain` or `text/*` will result
        in the response body being formatted as a plain text TAP report.
        When using the *xunit* reporter `application/xml` or `text/xml` will result
        in the response body being formatted as XML instead of JSONML.
        Otherwise the response body will be formatted as non-prettyprinted JSON.
      parameters:
      - name: mount

```http-spec
openapi: 3.0.2
paths:
  /_api/foxx/development:
    post:
      description: |2+
        Puts the service into development mode.
        While the service is running in development mode the service will be reloaded
        from the filesystem and its setup script (if any) will be re-executed every
        time the service handles a request.
        When running ArangoDB in a cluster with multiple Coordinators note that changes
        to the filesystem on one Coordinator will not be reflected across the other
        Coordinators. This means you should treat your Coordinators as inconsistent
        as long as any service is running in development mode.
      parameters:
      - name: mount
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
        description: |+

      responses:

        Coordinator.
