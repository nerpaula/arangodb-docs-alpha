        To start an execution you need to specify the algorithm name and a named graph
        (SmartGraph in cluster). Alternatively you can specify the vertex and edge
        collections. Additionally you can specify custom parameters which vary for each
        algorithm, see [Pregel - Available Algorithms](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/graphs-pregel.html#available-algorithms).

                    Name of a graph. Either this or the parameters `vertexCollections` and
                    `edgeCollections` are required.
                    Please note that there are special sharding requirements for graphs in order
                    to be used with Pregel.

                    General as well as algorithm-specific options.
                    The most important general option is "store", which controls whether the results
                    computed by the Pregel job are written back into the source collections or not.
                    Another important general option is "parallelism", which controls the number of
                    parallel threads that work on the Pregel job at most. If "parallelism" is not
                    specified, a default value may be used. In addition, the value of "parallelism"
                    may be effectively capped at some server-specific value.
                    The option "useMemoryMaps" controls whether to use disk based files to store
                    temporary results. This might make the computation disk-bound, but allows you to
                    run computations which would not fit into main memory. It is recommended to set
                    this flag for larger datasets.
                    The attribute "shardKeyAttribute" specifies the shard key that edge collections are
                    sharded after (default: `"vertex"`).

        Cancel an execution which is still running, and discard any intermediate
        results. This immediately frees all memory taken up by the execution, and
        makes you lose all intermediary data.
        You might get inconsistent results if you requested to store the results and
        then cancel an execution when it is already in its `"storing"` state (or
        `"done"` state in versions prior to 3.7.1). The data is written multi-threaded
        into all collection shards at once. This means there are multiple transactions
        simultaneously. A transaction might already be committed when you cancel the
        execution job. Therefore, you might see some updated documents, while other
        documents have no or stale results from a previous execution.
