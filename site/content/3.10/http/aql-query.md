### Explaining and parsing queries

ArangoDB has an HTTP interface to syntactically validate AQL queries.
Furthermore, it offers an HTTP interface to retrieve the execution plan for any
valid AQL query.

Both functionalities do not actually execute the supplied AQL query, but only
inspect it and return meta information about it.

You can also retrieve a list of all query optimizer rules and their properties.

<!-- js/actions/api-explain.js -->
```http-spec
openapi: 3.0.2
paths:
  /_api/explain:
    post:
      description: |2+
        To explain how an AQL query would be executed on the server, the query string
        can be sent to the server via an HTTP POST request. The server will then validate
        the query and create an execution plan for it. The execution plan will be
        returned, but the query will not be executed.
        The execution plan that is returned by the server can be used to estimate the
        probable performance of the query. Though the actual performance will depend
        on many different factors, the execution plan normally can provide some rough
        estimates on the amount of work the server needs to do in order to actually run
        the query.
        By default, the explain operation will return the optimal plan as chosen by
        the query optimizer The optimal plan is the plan with the lowest total estimated
        cost. The plan will be returned in the attribute *plan* of the response object.
        If the option *allPlans* is specified in the request, the result will contain
        all plans created by the optimizer. The plans will then be returned in the
        attribute *plans*.
        The result will also contain an attribute *warnings*, which is an array of
        warnings that occurred during optimization or execution plan creation. Additionally,
        a *stats* attribute is contained in the result with some optimizer statistics.
        If *allPlans* is set to *false*, the result will contain an attribute *cacheable*
        that states whether the query results can be cached on the server if the query
        result cache were used. The *cacheable* attribute is not present when *allPlans*
        is set to *true*.
        Each plan in the result is a JSON object with the following attributes:
        - *nodes*: the array of execution nodes of the plan.
        - *estimatedCost*: the total estimated cost for the plan. If there are multiple
          plans, the optimizer will choose the plan with the lowest total cost.
        - *collections*: an array of collections used in the query
        - *rules*: an array of rules the optimizer applied.
        - *variables*: array of variables used in the query (note: this may contain
          internal variables created by the optimizer)

            If the query is valid, the server will respond with *HTTP 200* and
            return the optimal execution plan in the *plan* attribute of the response.
            If option *allPlans* was set in the request, an array of plans will be returned
            in the *allPlans* attribute instead.
        '400':
          description: |2
            The server will respond with *HTTP 400* in case of a malformed request,
            or if the query contains a parse error. The body of the response will
            contain the error details embedded in a JSON object.
            Omitting bind variables if the query references any will also result
            in an *HTTP 400* error.
        '404':
          description: |2
            The server will respond with *HTTP 404* in case a non-existing collection is
            accessed in the query.

### Query tracking

ArangoDB has an HTTP interface for retrieving the lists of currently
executing AQL queries and the list of slow AQL queries. In order to make meaningful
use of these APIs, query tracking needs to be enabled in the database the HTTP 
request is executed for.

<!--arangod/RestHandler/RestQueryHandler.cpp -->
```http-spec
openapi: 3.0.2
paths:
  /_api/query/properties:
    get:
      description: |2+
        Returns the current query tracking configuration. The configuration is a
        JSON object with the following properties:
        - *enabled*: if set to *true*, then queries will be tracked. If set to
          *false*, neither queries nor slow queries will be tracked.
        - *trackSlowQueries*: if set to *true*, then slow queries will be tracked
          in the list of slow queries if their runtime exceeds the value set in
          *slowQueryThreshold*. In order for slow queries to be tracked, the *enabled*
          property must also be set to *true*.
        - *trackBindVars*: if set to *true*, then bind variables used in queries will
          be tracked.
        - *maxSlowQueries*: the maximum number of slow queries to keep in the list
          of slow queries. If the list of slow queries is full, the oldest entry in
          it will be discarded when additional slow queries occur.
        - *slowQueryThreshold*: the threshold value for treating a query as slow. A
          query with a runtime greater or equal to this threshold value will be
          put into the list of slow queries when slow query tracking is enabled.
          The value for *slowQueryThreshold* is specified in seconds.
        - *maxQueryStringLength*: the maximum query string length to keep in the
          list of queries. Query strings can have arbitrary lengths, and this property
          can be used to save memory in case very long query strings are used. The
          value is specified in bytes.

        Returns an array containing the last AQL queries that are finished and
        have exceeded the slow query threshold in the selected database.
        The maximum amount of queries in the list can be controlled by setting
        the query tracking property `maxSlowQueries`. The threshold for treating
        a query as *slow* can be adjusted by setting the query tracking property
        `slowQueryThreshold`.
        Each query is a JSON object with the following attributes:
        - *id*: the query's id
        - *database*: the name of the database the query runs in
        - *user*: the name of the user that started the query
        - *query*: the query string (potentially truncated)
        - *bindVars*: the bind parameter values used by the query
        - *started*: the date and time when the query was started
        - *runTime*: the query's total run time
        - *state*: the query's current execution state (will always be "finished"
          for the list of slow queries)
        - *stream*: whether or not the query uses a streaming cursor

### Killing queries

Running AQL queries can also be killed on the server. ArangoDB provides a kill facility
via an HTTP interface. To kill a running query, its id (as returned for the query in the
list of currently running queries) must be specified. The kill flag of the query will
then be set, and the query will be aborted as soon as it reaches a cancelation point.

<!--arangod/RestHandler/RestQueryHandler.cpp -->
```http-spec
openapi: 3.0.2
paths:
  /_api/query/{query-id}:
    delete:
      description: "\nKills a running query in the currently selected database. The\
        \ query will be \nterminated at the next cancelation point.\n\n"
      operationId: ' deleteQuery'

      - name: query-id
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
        description: |+
          The id of the query.
        in: path
      - name: all
        schema:
          type: boolean
        required: false

          \ all databases, \nnot just the selected one.\nUsing the parameter is only\
          \ allowed in the system database and with superuser\nprivileges.\n\n"
        in: query
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |2
            The server will respond with *HTTP 200* when the query was still running when
            the kill request was executed and the query's kill flag was set.
        '400':
          description: |2
            The server will respond with *HTTP 400* in case of a malformed request.
        '403':
          description: |2
            *HTTP 403* is returned in case the *all* parameter was used, but the request
            was made in a different database than _system, or by an non-privileged user.
        '404':
          description: |2
            The server will respond with *HTTP 404* when no query with the specified
            id was found.
