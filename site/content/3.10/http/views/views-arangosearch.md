                    Defines how to compress the primary sort data (introduced in v3.7.1).
                    ArangoDB v3.5 and v3.6 always compress the index using LZ4.
                    This option is immutable.
                    - `"lz4"` (default): use LZ4 fast compression.
                    - `"none"`: disable compression to trade space for speed.
                primarySortCache:
                  type: boolean
                  description: |+
                    If you enable this option, then the primary sort columns are always cached in
                    memory (introduced in v3.9.6, Enterprise Edition only). This can improve the
                    performance of queries that utilize the primary sort order. Otherwise, these
                    values are memory-mapped and it is up to the operating system to load them from
                    disk into memory and to evict them from memory.
                    This option is immutable.
                    See the `--arangosearch.columns-cache-limit` startup option to control the
                    memory consumption of this cache.

                    If you enable this option, then the primary key columns are always cached in
                    memory (introduced in v3.9.6, Enterprise Edition only). This can improve the
                    performance of queries that return many documents. Otherwise, these values are
                    memory-mapped and it is up to the operating system to load them from disk into
                    memory and to evict them from memory.

                    See the `--arangosearch.columns-cache-limit` startup option to control the

                storedValues:
                  type: array
                  format: object
                  items:
                    type: object
                  description: |+
                    An array of objects to describe which document attributes to store in the View
                    index (introduced in v3.7.1). It can then cover search queries, which means the
                    data can be taken from the index directly and accessing the storage engine can
                    be avoided.
                    This option is immutable.
                    Each object is expected in the following form:
                    `{ "fields": [ "attr1", "attr2", ... "attrN" ], "compression": "none", "cache": false }`
                    - The required `fields` attribute is an array of strings with one or more
                      document attribute paths. The specified attributes are placed into a single
                      column of the index. A column with all fields that are involved in common
                      search queries is ideal for performance. The column should not include too
                      many unneeded fields, however.
                    - The optional `compression` attribute defines the compression type used for
                      the internal column-store, which can be `"lz4"` (LZ4 fast compression, default)
                      or `"none"` (no compression).
                    - The optional `cache` attribute allows you to always cache stored values in
                      memory (introduced in v3.9.5, Enterprise Edition only). This can improve
                      the query performance if stored values are involved. See the
                      `--arangosearch.columns-cache-limit` startup option
                      to control the memory consumption of this cache.
                    The `storedValues` option is not to be confused with the `storeValues` option,
                    which allows to store meta data about attribute values in the View index.
                cleanupIntervalStep:
                  type: integer
                  format: int64
                  description: |+
                    Wait at least this many commits between removing unused files in the
                    ArangoSearch data directory (default: 2, to disable use: 0).
                    For the case where the consolidation policies merge segments often (i.e. a lot
                    of commit+consolidate), a lower value will cause a lot of disk space to be
                    wasted.
                    For the case where the consolidation policies rarely merge segments (i.e. few
                    inserts/deletes), a higher value will impact performance without any added
                    benefits.
                    _Background:_
                      With every "commit" or "consolidate" operation a new state of the View
                      internal data-structures is created on disk.
                      Old states/snapshots are released once there are no longer any users
                      remaining.
                      However, the files for the released states/snapshots are left on disk, and
                      only removed by "cleanup" operation.
                commitIntervalMsec:
                  type: integer
                  format: int64
                  description: |+
                    Wait at least this many milliseconds between committing View data store
                    changes and making documents visible to queries (default: 1000, to disable
                    use: 0).
                    For the case where there are a lot of inserts/updates, a lower value, until
                    commit, will cause the index not to account for them and memory usage would
                    continue to grow.
                    For the case where there are a few inserts/updates, a higher value will impact
                    performance and waste disk space for each commit call without any added
                    benefits.
                    _Background:_
                      For data retrieval ArangoSearch Views follow the concept of
                      "eventually-consistent", i.e. eventually all the data in ArangoDB will be
                      matched by corresponding query expressions.
                      The concept of ArangoSearch View "commit" operation is introduced to
                      control the upper-bound on the time until document addition/removals are
                      actually reflected by corresponding query expressions.
                      Once a "commit" operation is complete all documents added/removed prior to
                      the start of the "commit" operation will be reflected by queries invoked in
                      subsequent ArangoDB transactions, in-progress ArangoDB transactions will
                      still continue to return a repeatable-read state.
                consolidationIntervalMsec:
                  type: integer
                  format: int64
                  description: |+
                    Wait at least this many milliseconds between applying 'consolidationPolicy' to
                    consolidate View data store and possibly release space on the filesystem
                    (default: 10000, to disable use: 0).
                    For the case where there are a lot of data modification operations, a higher
                    value could potentially have the data store consume more space and file handles.
                    For the case where there are a few data modification operations, a lower value
                    will impact performance due to no segment candidates available for
                    consolidation.
                    _Background:_
                      For data modification ArangoSearch Views follow the concept of a
                      "versioned data store". Thus old versions of data may be removed once there
                      are no longer any users of the old data. The frequency of the cleanup and
                      compaction operations are governed by 'consolidationIntervalMsec' and the
                      candidates for compaction are selected via 'consolidationPolicy'.
                consolidationPolicy:
                  type: object
                  description: |+
                    The consolidation policy to apply for selecting which segments should be merged
                    (default: {})
                    _Background:_
                      With each ArangoDB transaction that inserts documents one or more
                      ArangoSearch internal segments gets created.
                      Similarly for removed documents the segments that contain such documents
                      will have these documents marked as 'deleted'.
                      Over time this approach causes a lot of small and sparse segments to be
                      created.
                      A "consolidation" operation selects one or more segments and copies all of
                      their valid documents into a single new segment, thereby allowing the
                      search algorithm to perform more optimally and for extra file handles to be
                      released once old segments are no longer used.
                    Sub-properties:
                      - `type` (string, _optional_):
                        The segment candidates for the "consolidation" operation are selected based
                        upon several possible configurable formulas as defined by their types.
                        The currently supported types are:
                        - `"tier"` (default): consolidate based on segment byte size and live
                          document count as dictated by the customization attributes. If this type
                          is used, then below `segments*` and `minScore` properties are available.
                        - `"bytes_accum"`: consolidate if and only if
                          `{threshold} > (segment_bytes + sum_of_merge_candidate_segment_bytes) / all_segment_bytes`
                          i.e. the sum of all candidate segment byte size is less than the total
                          segment byte size multiplied by the `{threshold}`. If this type is used,
                          then below `threshold` property is available.
                      - `threshold` (number, _optional_): value in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`
                      - `segmentsBytesFloor` (number, _optional_): Defines the value (in bytes) to
                        treat all smaller segments as equal for consolidation selection
                        (default: 2097152)
                      - `segmentsBytesMax` (number, _optional_): Maximum allowed size of all
                        consolidated segments in bytes (default: 5368709120)
                      - `segmentsMax` (number, _optional_): The maximum number of segments that will
                        be evaluated as candidates for consolidation (default: 10)
                      - `segmentsMin` (number, _optional_): The minimum number of segments that will
                        be evaluated as candidates for consolidation (default: 1)
                      - `minScore` (number, _optional_): (default: 0)

                    Maximum number of writers (segments) cached in the pool
                    (default: 64, use 0 to disable, immutable)
                writebufferActive:

                  description: |+
                    Maximum number of concurrent active writers (segments) that perform a
                    transaction. Other writers (segments) wait till current active writers
                    (segments) finish (default: 0, use 0 to disable, immutable)

                    Maximum memory byte size per writer (segment) before a writer (segment) flush
                    is triggered. `0` value turns off this limit for any writer (buffer) and data
                    will be flushed periodically based on the value defined for the flush thread
                    (ArangoDB server startup option). `0` value should be used carefully due to
                    high potential memory consumption

                    For the case where the consolidation policies merge segments often (i.e. a lot

                    use: 0).
                    For the case where there are a lot of inserts/updates, a lower value, until
                    commit, will cause the index not to account for them and memory usage would
                    continue to grow.
                    For the case where there are a few inserts/updates, a higher value will impact

                    benefits.
                    _Background:_
                      For data retrieval ArangoSearch Views follow the concept of

                      matched by corresponding query expressions.
                      The concept of ArangoSearch View "commit" operation is introduced to
                      control the upper-bound on the time until document addition/removals are
                      actually reflected by corresponding query expressions.

                    For the case where there are a lot of data modification operations, a higher
                    value could potentially have the data store consume more space and file handles.
                    For the case where there are a few data modification operations, a lower value
                    will impact performance due to no segment candidates available for
                    consolidation.
                    _Background:_
                      For data modification ArangoSearch Views follow the concept of a
                      "versioned data store". Thus old versions of data may be removed once there
                      are no longer any users of the old data. The frequency of the cleanup and
                      compaction operations are governed by 'consolidationIntervalMsec' and the
                      candidates for compaction are selected via 'consolidationPolicy'.

                    The consolidation policy to apply for selecting which segments should be merged
                    (default: {})
                    _Background:_
                      With each ArangoDB transaction that inserts documents one or more
                      ArangoSearch internal segments gets created.
                      Similarly for removed documents the segments that contain such documents
                      will have these documents marked as 'deleted'.
                      Over time this approach causes a lot of small and sparse segments to be
                      created.
                      A "consolidation" operation selects one or more segments and copies all of
                      their valid documents into a single new segment, thereby allowing the
                      search algorithm to perform more optimally and for extra file handles to be
                      released once old segments are no longer used.
                    Sub-properties:
                      - `type` (string, _optional_):
                        The segment candidates for the "consolidation" operation are selected based
                        upon several possible configurable formulas as defined by their types.
                        The currently supported types are:
                        - `"tier"` (default): consolidate based on segment byte size and live
                          document count as dictated by the customization attributes. If this type
                          is used, then below `segments*` and `minScore` properties are available.
                        - `"bytes_accum"`: consolidate if and only if
                          `{threshold} > (segment_bytes + sum_of_merge_candidate_segment_bytes) / all_segment_bytes`
                          i.e. the sum of all candidate segment byte size is less than the total
                          segment byte size multiplied by the `{threshold}`. If this type is used,
                          then below `threshold` property is available.
                      - `threshold` (number, _optional_): value in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`
                      - `segmentsBytesFloor` (number, _optional_): Defines the value (in bytes) to
                        treat all smaller segments as equal for consolidation selection
                        (default: 2097152)
                      - `segmentsBytesMax` (number, _optional_): Maximum allowed size of all
                        consolidated segments in bytes (default: 5368709120)
                      - `segmentsMax` (number, _optional_): The maximum number of segments that will
                        be evaluated as candidates for consolidation (default: 10)
                      - `segmentsMin` (number, _optional_): The minimum number of segments that will
                        be evaluated as candidates for consolidation (default: 1)
                      - `minScore` (number, _optional_): (default: 0)

                      Similarly for removed documents the segments that contain such documents
                      will have these documents marked as 'deleted'.
                      Over time this approach causes a lot of small and sparse segments to be
                      created.
                      A "consolidation" operation selects one or more segments and copies all of
                      their valid documents into a single new segment, thereby allowing the
                      search algorithm to perform more optimally and for extra file handles to be
                      released once old segments are no longer used.
                    Sub-properties:
                      - `type` (string, _optional_):
                        The segment candidates for the "consolidation" operation are selected based
                        upon several possible configurable formulas as defined by their types.
                        The currently supported types are:
                        - `"tier"` (default): consolidate based on segment byte size and live
                          document count as dictated by the customization attributes. If this type
                          is used, then below `segments*` and `minScore` properties are available.
                        - `"bytes_accum"`: consolidate if and only if
                          `{threshold} > (segment_bytes + sum_of_merge_candidate_segment_bytes) / all_segment_bytes`
                          i.e. the sum of all candidate segment byte size is less than the total
                          segment byte size multiplied by the `{threshold}`. If this type is used,
                          then below `threshold` property is available.
                      - `threshold` (number, _optional_): value in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`
                      - `segmentsBytesFloor` (number, _optional_): Defines the value (in bytes) to
                        treat all smaller segments as equal for consolidation selection
                        (default: 2097152)
                      - `segmentsBytesMax` (number, _optional_): Maximum allowed size of all
                        consolidated segments in bytes (default: 5368709120)
                      - `segmentsMax` (number, _optional_): The maximum number of segments that will
                        be evaluated as candidates for consolidation (default: 10)
                      - `segmentsMin` (number, _optional_): The minimum number of segments that will
                        be evaluated as candidates for consolidation (default: 1)
                      - `minScore` (number, _optional_): (default: 0)
