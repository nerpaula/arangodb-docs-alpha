The ArangoDB server is the core component of ArangoDB. The executable file to
run it is named `arangod`. The `d` stands for daemon. A daemon is a long-running
background process that answers requests for services.

_arangod_ can run in different modes for a variety of setups like single server
and clusters. It differs between the [Community Edition](../../about-arangodb/features/features-community-edition)
and [Enterprise Edition](../../about-arangodb/features/features-enterprise-edition).

See [Administration](../../administration/) for server configuration
and [Deployment](../../deployment/) for operation mode details.
