AQL queries can be executed using:

- the web interface,
- the `db` object (either in arangosh or in a Foxx service)
- or the raw HTTP API.

There are always calls to the server's API under the hood, but the web interface
and the `db` object abstract away the low-level communication details and are
thus easier to use.

The ArangoDB Web Interface has a [specific tab for AQL queries execution](invocation-with-web-interface).

You can run [AQL queries from the ArangoDB Shell](invocation-with-arangosh)
with the [_query](invocation-with-arangosh#with-db_query) and
[_createStatement](invocation-with-arangosh#with-db_createstatement-arangostatement) methods
of the [`db` object](../../appendix/references/appendix-references-dbobject). This chapter
also describes how to use bind parameters, statistics, counting and cursors with
arangosh.

If you are using Foxx, see [how to write database queries](../../foxx-microservices/foxx-getting-started#writing-database-queries)
for examples including tagged template strings.

If you want to run AQL queries from your application via the HTTP REST API,
see the full API description at [HTTP Interface for AQL Query Cursors](../../http/aql-query-cursors/).
